# How to contribute to `pip-review`

Please **do** contribute! In fact, please take over! See https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/issues/76.

I (@jgonggrijp) will not just abondon `pip-review`, but I am not using it anymore myself and I cannot dedicate any time to actively maintaining it, other than accepting pull requests and maybe issuing a new release once in a while. So if you see a way to improve `pip-review`, whether by fixing a bug or by adding a feature, please go ahead and submit a pull request.


## Suggestions

Any kind of contribution is welcome; nothing is "off limits". However, for those who would like some guidance:

  - Look for issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/help%20wanted), [question](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/question) or [poll](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/poll) label. In the latter case, if you have an opinion, vote by adding an emoticon of your choice to the opening post. Feel free to explain your vote in a response or to thumbs-up another response that explains your opinion.


## The fine print

This repo ([jgonggrijp/pip-review](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review)) uses [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). Please submit pull requests to the `develop` branch.

To maintain consistent coding style and formatting across the project, an [``EditorConfig`` file](/.editorconfig) has been set up, in order to guarantee that all contributors use the same settings for indentation, character encoding, line endings etc.

Additionally, please ensure that lines of code do not exceed a **maximum length of 79 characters** to further enhance readability and consistency of the project.
